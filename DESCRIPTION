Description: In a dilution series biological signal should follow a sigmoid
  curve ("dose response curve"). This behavior can be used for an automated 
  distinction between biological signals and non biological signals, like noise. 
  Additionally we want to find the range for which the intensity is related to the 
  concentration.
